<p><h1>About</h1></p>
<p>My name is Sphear Forde, and I am a currently a senior at New York City College of Technology pursuing a bachelor’s degree in Professional and Technical Writing with a specialization in Biology.
Outside of school and work, I enjoy reading, painting, and the outdoors. I also spend my free time working as a volunteer for The Campaign Against Hunger.</p>

<p>I created ‘Artesum’ to showcase the various paintings I created, as well as paintings in my house.</p>
