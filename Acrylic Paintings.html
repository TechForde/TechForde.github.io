	<p class="title"><strong>Hope</strong></p>
	<img src="hopeimage.jpg" alt="Hope Image" width="340" height="340">
	<p>This is a blank wooden “HOPE” sign I painted a few months ago using Apple Barrel acrylic paint. The green in this painting represents growth and prosperity. 
	The red represents the blood of our ancestors who fought for our freedom.  Black represents black people and the yellow represents wealth.</p>
		
	<p class="title"><strong>Panda</strong></p>
	<img src="pandaimage.jpg" alt="Panda Image" width="340" height="340">
	<p>This is a painting of a panda. I decided to paint the background yellow because it complements the black and white of the panda.
	   The yellow also represents happiness and warmth. Pandas are associated with happiness.</p>
