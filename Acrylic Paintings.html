	<p class="title"><strong>Hope</strong></p>
	<img src="hopeimage.jpg" alt="Hope Image" width="340" height="340">
	<p>This is a blank wooden “HOPE” sign I painted a few months ago using Apple Barrel acrylic paint. The green in this painting represents growth and prosperity. 
	The red represents the blood of our ancestors who fought for our freedom.  Black represents black people and the yellow represents wealth.</p>
		
	<p class="title"><strong>Panda</strong></p>
	<img src="pandaimage.jpg" alt="Panda Image" width="340" height="340">
	<p>This is a painting of a panda. I decided to paint the background yellow because it complements the black and white of the panda.
	   The yellow also represents happiness and warmth. Pandas are associated with happiness.</p>
		
	<p class="title"><strong>Cartoon Characters </strong></p>
	<img src="3imagepainting.jpg" alt="Sunrise Image" width="340" height="340">
	<p>This is a collage of three different cartoon paintings I did. The first one on the left is disciple me. 
	  The painting in the center is of a fire flower from super Mario bros.
	  The last painting is of SpongeBob from SpongeBob SquarePants.</p>
	
	<p class="title"><strong>Flowers</strong></p>
	<img src="Flowerimage.jpg" alt="Flowerimage" width="340" height="340">
	<p>This is a painting of blue and pink sunflowers. Sunflowers are one of my favorite flowers. I decided to paint the flowers pink and blue instead of yellow for aesthetic purposes. .</p>
