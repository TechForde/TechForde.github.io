	<img src="3imagepainting.jpg" alt="Sunrise Image" width="340" height="340">
	<p>This is a collage of three different cartoon paintings I did. The first one on the left is disciple me. 
	  The painting in the center is of a fire flower from super Mario bros.
	  The last painting is of SpongeBob from SpongeBob SquarePants.</p>
	
	<p class="title"><strong>Flowers</strong></p>
	<img src="Flowerimage.jpg" alt="Flowerimage" width="340" height="340">
	<p>This is a painting of blue and pink sunflowers. Sunflowers are one of my favorite flowers. I decided to paint the flowers pink and blue instead of yellow for aesthetic purposes.</p>
