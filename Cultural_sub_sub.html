<h1>Cultural Paintings History</h1>
	<p>The history of cultural paintings dates back thousands of years to the earliest civilizations. In ancient times, paintings were used to record events and tell stories. Overtime different cultures adapted their own form of painting.
Most cultural paintings in black homes depict important symbols, figures, or events from African, caribbean, and African American history and culture. The paintings on the two previous pages are examples of common cultural paintings you would find in a black household. </p>
